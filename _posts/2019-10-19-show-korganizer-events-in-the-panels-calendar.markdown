This is a video demonstration on how to install and setup kdepim-addons which binds the events shown in the KOrganizer app with the calendar in the KDE Plasma panel.

In order to install the entire KDE PIM suite, run:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt install kdepim
{% endhighlight %}

If you only want to connect KOrganizer with the panel, you probably only need:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt install kdepim-addons
{% endhighlight %}
